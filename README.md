```

## Usage üì¶

To generate a README for your project, navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal and run:

```bash
dokugen generate
```

To watch your project for changes and automatically update the README, use the `live` command:

```bash
dokugen live
```

You can also customize the behavior of the `live` command with the following options:

-   `-p, --paths <paths>`: Comma-separated paths to watch (default: `.`)
-   `-i, --ignore <patterns>`: Comma-separated patterns to ignore (default: `node_modules/**,.git/**,README.md`)
-   `-d, --debounce <ms>`: Debounce time in milliseconds (default: 2000)
-   `-n, --notifications`: Show desktop notifications on updates (default: false)
-   `-g, --generate`: Generate documentation on start (default: false)

For example:

```bash
dokugen live -p src,lib -i dist,docs -d 3000 -n
```
