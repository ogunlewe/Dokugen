## Usage

### Generating a README

To generate a README for your project, navigate to your project's root directory in the command line and run:

```bash
dokugen generate
```

This command analyzes your project and generates a `README.md` file in the root directory.

### Watching for Changes

To automatically update the README when your project changes, use the `live` command:

```bash
dokugen live
```

This command watches your project files and updates the README whenever a change is detected.

#### Options for `live` command:

-   `-p, --paths <paths>`: Comma-separated paths to watch (default: `.` - current directory)
-   `-i, --ignore <patterns>`: Comma-separated patterns to ignore (default: `node_modules/**,.git/**,README.md`)
-   `-d, --debounce <ms>`: Debounce time in milliseconds (default: `2000`)
-   `-n, --notifications`: Show desktop notifications on updates (default: `true`)
-   `-g, --generate`: Generate documentation on start (default: `false`)

### Configuration

Dokugen can be configured using a `.dokugenrc.json` file in your project's root directory. Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

```json
{
  "templates": ["default"],
  "watchPaths": ["."],
  "ignore": ["node_modules/**", ".git/**", "README.md"],
  "debounceTime": 2000,
  "autoCommit": true,
  "notification": false
}
```

#### Configuration Options:

-   `templates`: Array of template names to use.
